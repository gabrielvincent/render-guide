# React+GraphQL
Example app to show how to create an app using React and GraphQL.

This App acts as a catalog management system and uses some advanced VTEX IO GraphQL features, like `@cacheControl` directives.

## Cached Types
VTEX IO GraphQL increases the performance of your queries by caching types decorated with `@cacheControl` hints directly in the CDN. To know more about GraphQL cache hints, visit [apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/engine/caching.html)
